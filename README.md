# Paketo Jammy Tiny Builder

## `paketobuildpacks/builder-jammy-tiny`

This builder uses the [Paketo Jammy Tiny
Stack](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/jammy-tiny-stack) (Ubuntu Jammy
Jellyfish build image, distroless-like run image) with buildpacks for Java,
Java Native Image, Go, and Procfile.

To see which versions of build and run images, buildpacks, and the lifecycle
